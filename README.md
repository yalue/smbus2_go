A Pure Go Reimplementation of the smbus2 Python Package
=======================================================

About
-----

This project seeks to reimplement the [smbus2](https://github.com/kplindegaard/smbus2)
python package, which implements a particular SMBus API in pure python.
Similarly, the `smbus2_go` package uses pure Go to accomplish the same thing.
The point of the project is to make it easier to port some python robotics code
to Go on Raspberry Pi.

Most of the names from the python package have been changed to reflect Go
naming conventions.

(Still to write.)
