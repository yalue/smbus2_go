A Pure Go Reimplementation of the smbus2 Python Package
=======================================================

About
-----

This project seeks to reimplement the [smbus2](https://github.com/kplindegaard/smbus2)
python package, which implements a particular SMBus API in pure python.
Similarly, the `smbus2_go` package uses pure Go to accomplish the same thing.
The point of the project is to make it easier to port some python robotics code
to Go on Raspberry Pi.
